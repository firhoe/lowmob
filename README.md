# Lowmop¬Æ

This is a small front-end experiment developed with Create React App, in which we use the Spotify API to create a slightly interactive interface where you can visualize your playlists, favorite artists, top tracks, and much more... oh, and it also has a music playback bar. It really has many little interactions that I would love for you to discover!

## Authentication

The application uses the Spotify authentication flow to obtain an access token. To log in, a "Link up ‚úπ Spotify" button will be displayed on the home page. Upon clicking the button, you will be redirected to the Spotify website to log in and authorize the application. Once authorized, you will be redirected back to the application with a valid access token.

In case you don't have access, please use this account that will allow you to interact with the web interface:
```sh
Spotify account: new.user.test.spotify@gmail.com
```
```sh
Password: n3w-t3st-spotify
```
